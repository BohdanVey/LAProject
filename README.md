# Compare of image compression algorithm

## Authors: Bohdan Vey, Bohdan Sydor, Diana-Sofia Kmet



To run program change photos_dir in run_all.py into dir of photos, which you want to compress. 

Also you need to change SVD_rank

Then run program using python run_all.py

It will automatically create folder experiments, and put results into it.

It will create results folder where you can see, information about average loss(out_all*), and loss for every image(out*).

Then you can run image_combine.py file to combine all photos, and see result better.
